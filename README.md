# Covid-19 Dataset

#### Analyzed how Covid-19 has affected different countries by examining the total deaths  and the progress of vaccination efforts in each of them.

#### Purpose of this project is to provide valuable information to the public and the scientific community to better understand the pandemic's dynamics.

#### Within this project, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to conduct Data Exploration, subsequently transforming the acquired data into compelling visualizations using Tableau.
